<H2>Studying HTML 나는 왜 HTML을 공부할까</h2>
this is webpage for practicing <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html5.2 Specification">Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</a></strong>.
I'm planning to study <u>computer programing</u> and this will be my second learning time.<br><br><br>
<p>I am studying python at the same time, because many advice were found that
python is relatively easy to learn. As you may guess, i didn't start learning
programming language for specific purpose. I know about 'web' today and
i don't still know what kind of areas are there outside of web programming.
But i can say i just started and i will try my best to keep this passion to learn.</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">The thing i consider as final project is making a game. i myself is gammer and
feminist, i got too frustrated about how and what games ares talking about woman.
not only those treat woman as sexsual object and well-selling object but also
those subordinating female characters to male hero therefore consuming woman during their
story make me feel bad. so i want to make a game that doesn't have view or story
like that.</p>
